***NOTE:*** This is a multi-day project take your time building your relationships, Draw them out it will help.

Although it may be the "Final Frontier" but we can still learn a lot from what we already know about SPACE....

Perhaps one of the most difficult problems we face when building software is managing the relationships between objects. Life has almost an immeasurable level of connections and it is this vastness that makes building scalable software tasking. Fortunately most relationships can be describe as one of the following connections. 

- <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_(data_model)” target=”_blank”>One to One</a>
- <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-many_(data_model)” target=”_blank”>One to Many</a>
- <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-to-many_(data_model)” target=”_blank”>Many to Many</a>

Intelligent software companies will take a careful amount of time planning out these relationships prior to ever writing their first line of code for an application. While it may apear to many as a slow way to start an application having a clear consice plan of these relationships will save countless hours and <a href="http://rs674.pbsrc.com/albums/vv101/reeenda/writing_process.gif~c200" target="_blank">keyboard headbanging (***WARNING: Graphic stick figure death***)</a> from being the number one cause of death for a developer. 

Real world relationships are complex and often look something like <a href=”http://boycottnovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/software-map-with-arrows.png” target="_blank">this</a> when brought into code

With all of the complexities involved in building out all of these relationships developers often turn to an <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping” target=”_blank”>ORM (Object Relational Mapper).</a>

For our purposes we will use a framework called <a href=”http://www.js-data.io/” target=”_blank”>js-data.</a> One of the best benefits to an ORM is they provide us with a programmable interface (**not a GUI**) that allows us to write all of our code the same regardless of the type of database that we are storing our information to. This flexibility helps tremendously when developers need to switch between test data and production data.  This quick switching of entire datastores is a small glimpse at one of the <a href=”https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#dependency-inversion-principle” target=”_blank”>S.O.L.I.D principles of Object Oriented programming</a>

###Let’s start mapping

This project has provided the basic starting points of an application to manage Galaxies, I know a big task right. Thinking about the relationships of space you will need to create a model for each of the files in the models directory. Every Model will need its own route handler as well. The type of data that you store on each model is up to you. You will want to use the Schemator to ensure data integrity.

You have a mostly working example in the Galaxy Model and Galaxy Routes. Both of these files will need expanded on so you can of course edit the information that you store about each item in your universe but, take your time to work on the relationships and the ability to create and read data first. Also take you time to really map out each of the items and try to identify the relationships they have between each other. The js-data syntax is a bit odd when it comes to identifying your relationships but here is a quick map to help you visualize.

```javascript
relations: {
    // hasMany uses "localField" and "localKeys" or "foreignKey"
    hasMany: {
      comment: {
        // localField is for linking relations
        // user.comments -> array of comments of the user
        localField: 'comments',
        // foreignKey is the "join" field
        // the name of the field on a comment that points to its parent user
        foreignKey: 'userId'
      }
    },
    // hasOne uses "localField" and "localKey" or "foreignKey"
    hasOne: {
      profile: {
        // localField is for linking relations
        // user.profile -> profile of the user
        localField: 'profile',
        // foreignKey is the "join" field
        // the name of the field on a profile that points to its parent user
        foreignKey: 'userId'
      }
    },
    // belongsTo uses "localField" and "localKey"
    belongsTo: {
      organization: {
        // localField is for linking relations
        // user.organization -> organization of the user
        localField: 'organization',
        // localKey is the "join" field
        // the name of the field on a user that points to its parent organization
        localKey: 'organizationId',
        // if you add this to a belongsTo relation
        // then js-data will attempt to use
        // a nested url structure, e.g. /organization/15/user/4
        parent: true
      }
}
```

###First Steps

- Identify the relationships between each of your models

Galaxy -> Star/Planet/Moon/Species
Star -> Galaxy/Planet/Moon/Species
Planet -> Galaxy/Star/Moon/Species
Moon -> Galaxy/Star/Planet/Species
Species -> Galaxy/Star/Planet/Moon // Hint save species for last Many to Many here it gets complicated

- Build your models
	- Know what each object is going to look like.
	- Write your methods for `create`, `getAll`, `getOne`
	- Use the Schemator to qualify your data has the necessary fields
	- Think about what the absolute necessary data needed is to create the object…. Don’t let objects be created if they don’t follow your format. 
	- Remember everything is Async :)

- Get your Test Data in
	- Start with galaxies and stars -> planets -> moons -> species
Good Luck if you get stuck please ask for help.
